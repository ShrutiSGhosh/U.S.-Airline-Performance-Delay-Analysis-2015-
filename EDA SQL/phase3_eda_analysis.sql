-- ============================================

-- 🔹 Block 1: Flight Volume Summary
-- ✅ Interpretation: ATL is the busiest origin with 66K+ departures. ORD, DFW, and LAX follow. High-frequency airports are potential hubs and key for operational focus.

-- 🔹 Block 2: Monthly Trends
-- ✅ Interpretation: July is the busiest month, followed by June and August—likely due to summer travel. February has the fewest flights.

-- 🔹 Block 3: Weekday Trends
-- ✅ Interpretation: Fridays have the highest flight volumes, followed by Thursdays. Saturdays and Sundays see the least traffic, suggesting lower business travel.

-- 🔹 Block 4: Time of Day Trends
-- ✅ Interpretation: Most flights are scheduled between 6 AM and 7 PM. Early morning (6–9 AM) is peak departure time. Red-eye flights are limited.

-- 🔹 Block 5: Airline-Level Performance Summary
-- ✅ Interpretation: Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines lead with >85% OTP and <1% cancellations. American Eagle and Frontier show weak performance with high delay and cancellation rates. Delta has balanced performance with high volume and good OTP.

-- 🔹 Block 6: Origin Airport-Level Departure Performance
-- ✅ Interpretation: ATL leads in departures with strong OTP (81.6%). ORD shows weakest OTP (67%) and highest avg delay (20 mins). SLC and SEA are top performers with >85% OTP and <7 min delays.

-- 🔹 Block 7: Route-Level Performance Summary
-- ✅ Interpretation: Hawaiian Airlines dominates intra-island routes with ≥90% OTP and negligible cancellations. Delta’s MCO ➝ ATL shows early arrivals. LGA and ORD routes face high cancellations (5–7%).

-- 🔹 Block 8: Destination Airport-Level Arrival Performance
-- ✅ Interpretation: ATL has highest arrivals with 83% OTP. ORD and DFW have weaker performance with high delays (10–15 mins) and cancellations (6–7%). LGA and BOS show OTP challenges and high cancellation rates.

-- 🔹 Block 9: Delay Causes by Airline
-- ✅ Interpretation: Frontier and American Eagle have the highest delay rates (~30%). Frontier suffers from systemic and turnaround delays. Hawaiian Airlines is the most reliable (8.48% delay rate). Delta and Southwest manage delays well at scale.
